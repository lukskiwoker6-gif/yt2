🧊 Greenland Emerges as a Strategic Flashpoint as Arctic Ice Retreats

Melting Arctic ice is rapidly turning Greenland into a key geopolitical and maritime hotspot, positioned between the US and Russia. Shrinking sea ice is opening new shipping routes, exposing critical mineral resources, and increasing military interest in the region. The Arctic sea ice extent has dropped by around 27% compared with late 20th-century averages, making routes like the Northern Sea Route increasingly viable for commercial shipping.

At the same time, strategic competition is intensifying. The US maintains missile and space operations at Pituffik Base, Russia has expanded Arctic military infrastructure, and China has declared itself a “near-Arctic state” while deploying icebreakers and investing in Greenland’s rare earth projects. As climate change reshapes access to sea lanes and resources, Greenland is becoming a frontline of global power competition rather than a remote Arctic outpost.
